  <h1 > My Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>
    My name is <a class= "red" href="https://www.instagram.com/thesquishyasianarts/" target_blank> Annie Lichter</a> Annie Lichter and I am a Chicago based artist with a focus on Ceramics and Sculpture. I have always had a passionate love for art ever since I was little. Throughout the years that I have taken art classes, I have always gone into each class with an open mind, a positive mindset, and a hard work ethic. I feel as though this mindset has helped me to become a better artist because I am always willing to go outside of my comfort zone and try new things. While I do have my strengths in my art classes, I believe that there is always room for more improvement. When creating my pieces I try to make my next piece even more challenging and more detailed than the previous one. I try to not only make art that is appealing to me, but also to my audience. I always keep my audience in mind because they are the ones who will be critiquing my work. Not only do I prioritize making visually pleasing pieces, but I also try to tell a whole story through each piece.
